# Overview

This is a professional-grade automated trading bot for MetaTrader 5 that implements live forex trading using an EMA/RSI scalping strategy. The application features a sophisticated PyQt5 GUI for real-time monitoring and control, comprehensive risk management, and direct integration with MT5 for executing trades with real money on live trading accounts.

The bot is designed as a complete trading solution with real-time dashboard, equity curve visualization, position monitoring, and extensive logging capabilities. It supports multiple currency pairs simultaneously and includes robust error handling and system diagnostics.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt5-based desktop application with dark theme
- **Main Window**: Central dashboard with tabbed interface for different trading views
- **Real-time Updates**: Timer-based UI updates for live account data, positions, and equity curves
- **Widget System**: Modular widget components (AccountInfoWidget, PositionsWidget, EquityChartWidget) for reusable UI elements
- **Threading**: Separate threads for GUI updates to prevent blocking the trading engine

## Backend Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Core trading functionality separated into distinct modules (mt5_client, trade_engine, strategy, risk management)
- **Trade Engine**: Central coordinator that manages strategy signals, risk validation, and trade execution
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable strategy system with EMA/RSI scalping as the default implementation
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time processing of market data and account updates
- **Threading**: Multi-threaded architecture with thread-safe operations for concurrent trading and GUI updates

## Trading Strategy
- **EMA Crossover**: Uses fast (12-period) and slow (26-period) Exponential Moving Averages for trend detection
- **RSI Confirmation**: 14-period RSI with overbought (70) and oversold (30) levels for signal confirmation
- **Scalping Focus**: 1-minute timeframe for high-frequency trading opportunities
- **Multi-Symbol Support**: Simultaneous trading across multiple currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, etc.)

## Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Automatic lot size calculation based on account risk percentage (default 1% per trade)
- **Drawdown Protection**: Maximum drawdown limits (10%) with emergency stop functionality
- **Daily Limits**: Maximum daily loss (5%) and maximum daily trades (50) protection
- **Spread Control**: Maximum allowed spread filtering (2 pips)
- **Position Limits**: Maximum concurrent positions (5) to control exposure

## Data Storage
- **In-Memory Storage**: Real-time data stored in memory structures for fast access
- **Session Tracking**: Performance metrics, trade history, and equity curves maintained during session
- **CSV Export**: Trade history and performance reports exportable to CSV format
- **No Database**: Currently uses file-based and in-memory storage without external database

## Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: MT5 credentials and trading parameters configurable via environment variables
- **Default Fallbacks**: Sensible defaults for all configuration parameters
- **Runtime Configuration**: Some settings adjustable through the GUI during operation

## Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Multi-level logging with file rotation and console output
- **System Diagnostics**: Startup checks for MT5 installation, network connectivity, and system resources
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error recovery mechanisms throughout the application
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of connection status, account health, and system performance

# External Dependencies

- Cleaned up duplicate RiskManager definitions and added all missing methods
- Resolved all LSP diagnostics and syntax validation
- Ensured thread-safe operations across all components

The project has been successfully migrated from Replit Agent to the standard Replit environment with the following adaptations:

### Security and Compatibility Improvements
- **Environment Adaptation**: Project now runs cleanly in Linux environment with proper fallback for Windows-only MT5 package
- **Dependency Management**: Core packages (pandas, numpy, PyQt5) installed via Replit package manager
- **Demo Mode**: Robust demo mode with simulated trading data when MT5 is unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for cross-platform compatibility

### Current Status
- **Console Demo**: Fully functional with simulated market data
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard showing account info, market data, and strategy analysis
- **Demo Trading**: Safe simulation mode for testing without real money
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Linux (Replit) and Windows (with MT5)

### Next Steps for Users
- For live trading: Install on Windows machine with MetaTrader 5
- For development/testing: Continue using the demo mode on Replit
- All core functionality preserved and enhanced for better reliability
