# Complete Improvement Prompt for Trading Bot

## Objectives
Enhance the trading bot to ensure its reliability in auto trading, analysis, symbol detection, buy/sell order execution, and performance monitoring.

## Checklist

1. **Dependency Management**
   - [ ] Ensure all required packages are installed, specifically `MetaTrader5`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.
   - [ ] Confirm compatibility of libraries with your operating system.

2. **Error Logging**
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for all functions, especially critical areas like order execution and connection checks.
   - [ ] Ensure all errors are captured and logged, including stack traces for deeper insights.

3. **Input Validation**
   - [ ] Validate user inputs within the GUI, particularly for trading parameters (e.g., lot sizes, risk percentages).
   - [ ] Add checks for valid symbol selection to prevent errors during trading activities.

4. **Connection Management**
   - [ ] Ensure robust logic for handling MT5 connections, including reconnection attempts with appropriate backoff strategies.
   - [ ] Log connection statuses to keep track of connectivity.

5. **Trading Logic Enhancements**
   - [ ] Update trading logic to dynamically adjust to market conditions and user-selected strategies.
   - [ ] Ensure that the strategy works without requiring restarts and can switch based on user interactions.

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Implement features to generate and display real-time performance metrics, such as profits and risk assessments, on the GUI.
   - [ ] Ensure trading statistics are accurately reported and periodically sent to Telegram.

7. **Symbol Detection and Management**
   - [ ] Implement or improve the auto-detection mechanism for trading symbols, including testing common variations.
   - [ ] Ensure the selected symbol is validated before any trading operation.

8. **Error Handling in Trading Functions**
   - [ ] Enhance error handling in order execution functions to gracefully recover from failures.
   - [ ] Implement retries for failed orders, with exponential backoff.

9. **Testing and Debugging**
   - [ ] Conduct thorough unit and integration tests, ensuring all functions complete as expected under various market conditions.
   - [ ] Test for edge casesâ€”such as connection failures or invalid trading parameters.

10. **User Feedback Mechanism**
    - [ ] Ensure the GUI provides clear feedback on trading status, including successful trades, errors, and performance reports.
    - [ ] Integrate user notifications via Telegram for real-time updates and alerts.

## Next Steps
- Go through each item systematically.
- Update the bot's codebase accordingly and test improvements.
- Run simulated trading to observe how the bot performs before going live.

By following this checklist, your bot should become more robust, capable of seamless auto trading and analysis. Ensure to test thoroughly after making each modification for optimal performance.
